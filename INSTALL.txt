Prerequisites:
A webserver with PHP (>= 5.2) and the PHP-option 'allow_url_fopen' set to 1 (allow opening remote files)

Install:
After cloning the source-files to e.g. the document-root of your webserver, you need to set up 
two jobs (e.g. cronjobs) in order to enable the management of a history of status-JSON-files.


Examples for using cron:
Open the crontab-editor using 'sudo crontab -e' (to run commands with administrative privileges).

Add following lines:
* * * * 0 find /var/www/html/pi-network/history -type f -mtime +7 -delete
0 * * * * wget -qO /dev/null "http://143.205.122.89/pi-network/stat.php?action=save&key=8A29691737D"

Don't forget to save your changes.
Exit the Editor.




* * * * 0 find /var/www/html/pi-network/history -type f -mtime +7 -delete
The command in this line is executed EVERY SUNDAY and deletes all JSON-files in the
history-folder that are older than ONE WEEK.

0 * * * * wget -qO /dev/null "http://143.205.122.89/pi-network/stat.php?action=save&key=8A29691737D"
The command in this line is executed EVERY HOUR and calls the PHP-script 'stat.php' in a way,
that lets it archive all JSON-files that are currently in the same directory as 'stat.php' in the 
history-folder.
